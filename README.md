# HBCLIH
HandBrake CLI Helping Tool . Basic Quee Support, Settings CFG File

Just edit Settings.cfg with your preferences and run it

Settings .cfg support
Allow change input folder
Allow file recursive check for input folder
Allow change output folder
Allow change input .ext
Allow change output .ext
Allow change Handbrake folder
Allow change Handbrake Command
Allow replace/skip file when output file with same name is found

Path Names can't contain spaces so make a brand new folder on your Desktop and use it :D
Example: C:\Users\YOURUSERNAME\Desktop\HBCLIH

You can set for example your Downloads folder in input folder, ex FilePath=C:\Users\YOURUSERNAME\Downloads
It will only check for files with your input .ext

This tool will auto rename a file which contains spaces. example File 1 with spaces.mkv to example_File_1_with_spaces.mkv

Since Handbrake CLI is a cmd tool it cant check files with spaces or dir with spaces so avoid them

This isnt the proper way of doing the things but works for my needs

Enjoy
